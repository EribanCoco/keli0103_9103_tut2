### Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
The art of Piet Mondrian, particularly his use of **neoplasticism** and **geometric** abstraction, serves as a major inspiration for my project. His use of bold primary colors, straight lines, and simple geometric forms creates a sense of **order and rhythm**. I aim to incorporate these elements into my project by using a grid-like structure and a limited color palette to convey a **harmonious, dynamic visual composition**. Mondrian's style is effective for exploring structure, balance, and movement, aligning well with the goals of the assignment.

In fact, the work I submitted for Quiz 1 was also inspired by Mondrian, so I want to explore more possibilities based on his works.

### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
To achieve a Mondrian-inspired aesthetic using coding, I’m excited to explore the **Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm**, which is ideal for procedural generation of images, textures, and even game level designs. <br>
Inspired by Mondrian’s style, I can use WFC to create digital art with structured, grid-based aesthetics while introducing dynamic complexity. The algorithm, rooted in principles of quantum mechanics, uses predefined tiles or patterns to generate intricate structures, ensuring each element respects the local constraints of its neighbors.This approach allows me to experiment with different configurations of colored blocks, maintaining visual coherence similar to Mondrian’s geometric abstraction.
